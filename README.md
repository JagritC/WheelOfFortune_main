# Wheel of Fortune

A browser-based, two-player **Wheel of Fortune** game built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite. Spin the wheel, guess letters, buy vowels, and race to solve the puzzle across three rounds.

## Gameplay

Two players take turns at the same keyboard/screen.

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Spin** | Randomly lands on a dollar amount, BANKRUPT, or LOSE A TURN |
| **Guess a consonant** | Earn the landed amount × occurrences of that letter |
| **Buy a vowel** | Costs $500, no spin required |
| **Solve** | Type the full puzzle to bank your round earnings |
| **BANKRUPT** | Lose your entire round balance; turn passes |
| **LOSE A TURN** | Turn passes with no penalty to balance |

Three rounds are played; the player with the highest **total** balance at the end wins. Results are saved to a persistent leaderboard.

### Architecture highlights

- **`gameEngine.ts`** is a pure, side-effect-free state machine. Every action (`doSpin`, `doGuessConsonant`, `doBuyVowel`, `doSolveAttempt`, …) takes the current `EngineState` and returns a new one. React is never imported here.
- **`TurnPhase`** is a discriminated union that enforces which buttons are valid at any moment, making invalid UI states structurally impossible.
- **`wheel.ts`** defines 16 wedges matching the classic TV show layout (including two BANKRUPT and one LOSE A TURN wedge).
