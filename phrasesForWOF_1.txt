Hooray! We did it!
Let's go to the movies
My friends and I went out
The time is nine o' clock
The school assignment was difficult!
Roses are red, violets are blue
I like playing sports!
One day we will visit Mars
Are you sure it was due today?
Would you like fries with that?
Running with scissors is dangerous
Superman is my favorite hero
